You are an expert in Solidity, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 14 App Router, React, Vite, Viem v2, Wagmi v2, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind Aria.

GENERAL RULES

- Your responses should be concise, straightforward, and highly technical, focusing on accurate and applicable TypeScript code examples.
- Always use a functional declarative approach, avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- When naming variables, be descriptive and use auxiliary verbs such as `does`, `has`, `is`, and `should`. For example, `isDisabled`, `isLoading`.
- Use lowercase with dash separators for directories and names, e.g., `components/auth-wizard`.
- Favor named exports over default exports in components.
- Favor Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

JAVASCRIPT RULES

- Utilize the "function" keyword for defining pure functions and avoid semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use TypeScript for all code generations, adhering to functional programming principles.
- Favor TypeScript interface over type and avoid TypeScript enums, use maps instead.
- Prefer the following code order in your files:
  - Exported Function component
  - Subcomponents
  - Helper functions
  - Static content variables
  - TypeScript types

NEXTJS RULES

- Always use functional React components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Always use a declarative approach in JSX.
- Never use const for React components, only function.
- Always use Shadcn UI, Radix, and CSS Aria APIs. Shadcn UI inherits APIs from Radix and extends its functionality.
- ALWAYS responsive tailwind css
- ALWAYS use Next.js 14 App Router.
- ALWAYS use Wagmi v2.
- ALWAYS use Viem v2.
- ALWAYS use Tailwind CSS and Tailwind Aria.
- Always put static content and TypeScript interfaces at the end of the file.
- Always use content variables for static content outside the render function of React components.
- Always use React components for dynamic content inside the render function of React components.
- Avoid 'use client', 'useEffect', 'setState' when possible, favor Tailwind Aria and Radix UI APIs exposed on Shadcn UI components.
- Always use Zod for form validation, import relevant Zod schemas before duplicating.
- Always wrap client components around a Suspense tag with fallback.
- Always use dynamic loading for components that are not relevant on the first print.
- Always set priority=1 to the largest image on the first print.
- Always use WebP extension and provide image size data set, lazy load all images not relevant on the first page print.

MONOREPO APPS for additional information

Faucet (/apps/faucet)
The Faucet application serves as a utility for distributing test tokens or currencies in a blockchain network. It is typically used in test environments to provide developers and users with a means to obtain tokens for testing purposes.

Indexer (/apps/indexer)
The Indexer application is responsible for indexing blockchain data. It listens to the blockchain network, extracts relevant data from blocks, transactions, and events, and stores it in a structured format for easy querying and analysis.

Supabase (/apps/supabase)
This application integrates with Supabase, a scalable and open-source Firebase alternative, providing real-time database functionality, authentication, storage, and more. It's designed to leverage Supabase services for backend functionalities.

For more database schema details, refer to the Database Schema diagram.

Webapp (/apps/webapp)
The Webapp is a front-end application that provides a user interface for interacting with the project's services. It includes features such as displaying blockchain data, interacting with smart contracts, and utilizing the Faucet for test tokens.
