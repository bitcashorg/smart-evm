They explain that these models tend to produce more 'peaky' results, with lower variation compared to base models which yield more diverse outputs. The speaker appreciates the base model for tasks that require a high level of creativity or diversity, providing an example of generating new Pokémon names.

They note the transformer's inability to recover from bad reasoning paths, and discuss techniques to help the AI models rectify these situations.\n\nThe talk provides insights into the usage and engineering of prompts to enhance the effectiveness of language models like GPT-4. The speaker discusses the importance of specific prompts that ask the model to self-evaluate and improve, in order to compensate for the lack of spontaneous reassessment in these models. Drawing a parallel to the concept of System 1 (fast, automatic) and System 2 (slower, deliberate) in human cognition, the speaker explores how this dichotomy can be recreated in language models through prompt engineering and additional Python 'glue' code. A recent technique, \"Tree of Thought\", is cited, which maintains multiple completions for a given prompt and scores them along the way. The speaker also introduces the concepts of using a sequence of thought-action-observation to answer queries and tool use by the model."
