Jeffrey elucidates the potential of such models. He anticipates superior predictive capabilities, especially predicting user group behaviors, such as churning, purchasing, or upselling. Jeffrey's vision extends to understanding deeper patterns in sessions, enabling unsupervised categorization of users based on future outcomes. This would assist in discerning the reasons behind behavioral disparities and attempt to answer challenging questions on causation in product analytics. Furthermore, Jeffrey highlights the challenges of data interpretation in tools that automatically record user sessions due to the noise in data. Ideally, a perfect behavioral model could interpret such data, eliminating the need for manual instrumentation. While such a model is still in the realm of speculation, the aspiration is to make the analytics process seamless and more intuitive in the future. The conversation concludes with Swyx expressing gratitude to the listeners."
