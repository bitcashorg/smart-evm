This means that transactions are often slow and costly, and can be subject to censorship or freeze by the controlling entity. Bitcoin, on the other hand, operates on a decentralized network, meaning that no single entity controls it. This allows for fast, secure, and borderless transactions, as well as greater financial freedom and autonomy."

This can lead to a loss of purchasing power over time, and can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to plan for the future. Bitcoin, however, has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which means that it is immune to inflation in the traditional sense. This helps to ensure that the value of Bitcoin remains stable over time and allows for more predictable financial planning."

Today, millions of people around the world are unbanked or underbanked, which means that they do not have access to traditional financial services. Bitcoin, however, can be used by anyone with an internet connection, which means that it has the potential to bring financial services to people who have been excluded from the traditional banking system. This can help to reduce poverty and create greater economic opportunities for people around the world."

This was a major step forward for the technology, as it made it more accessible to a wider audience. The same year, the first Bitcoin purchase was made, when Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer, paid 10,000 Bitcoins for two Papa John's pizzas."
