The paper investigates the composability of LoRA for cross-task generalization. LoraHub allows for the assembly of LoRA modules trained on various tasks to achieve adaptable performance on unseen tasks. With just a few examples from a new task, LoraHub enables the fluid combination of multiple LoRA modules, eliminating the need for human expertise. The composition requires neither additional model parameters nor gradients. The empirical results, derived from the Big-Bench Hard (BBH) benchmark, suggest that LoraHub can effectively mimic the performance of in-context learning in few-shot scenarios, excluding the necessity of in-context examples alongside each inference input. A significant contribution of this research is the fostering of a community for LoRA, where users can share their trained LoRA modules, thereby facilitating their application to new tasks (Page 1)."

The goal is to modify the model to adapt to the new task using only these examples. A straightforward method would be to directly fine-tune the weights of the model based on these examples, resulting in an updated model with improved performance on the new task (Pages 2-3)."

The empirical results on the BBH benchmark demonstrate that LoraHub can effectively match the performance of in-context learning in few-shot scenarios, removing the need for in-context examples during inference. The authors conclude that their work shows the promise of strategic LoRA composability for rapidly adapting LLMs to diverse tasks, fostering reuse and combination of LoRA modules, and working towards more general and adaptable LLMs while minimizing training costs (Page 9)."
