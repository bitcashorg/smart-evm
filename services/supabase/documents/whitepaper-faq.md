Token sales on Bitlauncher typically use a batch auction mechanism for fair price discovery. Participants can place bids at various prices within a specified timeframe. At the end of the auction, an equilibrium price is determined, and all bids above this price are fulfilled.

### What is a batch auction?
A batch auction is a market structure where the price of an offering is established after taking in all bids to determine the highest price at which the total offering can be sold. This method ensures fair price discovery and prevents front-running or other manipulative practices.

### How do I participate in a token sale?
To participate in a token sale, ensure you have completed registration and KYC verification. Deposit funds into your Bitlauncher account, then navigate to the active token sale. Place your bids according to the auction rules, specifying the amount and price you're willing to pay.

### Is there a limit to how many tokens I can purchase?
Purchase limits may vary for each token sale. These limits are often implemented to ensure fair distribution and prevent concentration of ownership. Always check the specific terms of each sale for any applicable limits.

### When do I receive tokens after a successful bid?
Token distribution typically occurs within two weeks after the conclusion of the token sale. The exact timing may vary depending on the project and will be communicated clearly for each sale.

### What happens if my bid is unsuccessful?
If your bid is below the final clearing price of the auction, it will not be executed. Any funds allocated to unsuccessful bids will remain in your Bitlauncher account and can be used for future auctions or withdrawn.
