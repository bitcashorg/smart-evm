The proof-of-work algorithm is a complex mathematical problem that is designed to be difficult to solve but easy to verify. Miners use specialized hardware, known as ASICs, to solve the proof-of-work algorithm, and they are rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins for each block they mine. The reward for mining is halved every 210,000 blocks, and the total number of bitcoins in circulation will never exceed 21 million."
