By using blockchain technology, it allows for a more secure, transparent, and decentralized way of accessing financial services. It also has the potential to provide financial services to the unbanked population. But it's important to approach it with caution, as there may be legal and regulatory uncertainties, and the value of a cryptocurrency can be highly volatile. With the right approach and research, you can use DeFi to achieve your financial goals."
