The journey began with an app called Magic Sudoku, an augmented reality game designed to solve Sudoku puzzles by hovering the phone over it. The creators, after gaining attention for this concept, explored other potential applications. They aimed to add a software layer to the real world, allowing users to interact with objects through a mobile app. They focused on board games initially, starting with Boggle, a game that has players form words from adjacent letter tiles. They then moved onto Chess, developing an app within 48 hours during a hackathon at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2019. This app recognized a chessboard's state and suggested moves. Evan Spiegel, the founder of Snapchat, took an interest in their work at this hackathon. Though they didn't win awards at Disrupt, they gained recognition and subsequently won a $15,000 grant from a Des Moines contest. The podcast also touched upon the confusion around John Papa John, a supporter of the Iowa entrepreneurial scene, who is often mistakenly associated with the pizza brand due to the similarity in name."
