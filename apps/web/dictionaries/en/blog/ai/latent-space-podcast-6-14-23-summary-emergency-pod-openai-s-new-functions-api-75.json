Riley Goodside remarks on the potential shift from English language prompting back to more structured prompts, due to the ambiguity and unpredictability of natural language. The excitement around language models, he mentions, is the potential to democratize automation. Alex Volkov expresses enthusiasm about a transition akin to moving from JavaScript to TypeScript. Roie, from Pinecone, focuses on the surprising reduction in embedding costs, pondering the reasons behind the drastic price drop. Swyx chimes in with potential explanations, mentioning infrastructure improvements and a shift in model versions that could have led to cheaper inferences. He also comments on the strategic significance of reducing embedding costs to potentially lock users into OpenAI's ecosystem. Alex stresses OpenAI's stance on not using data provided via its API for training."
