By creating a tamper-proof digital ledger, blockchain allows companies to track the movement of goods through the supply chain in real-time, increasing transparency and reducing the risk of fraud. This is particularly useful in industries like food and retail, where the ability to trace products back to their origin is essential.\n\nThe legal industry is also exploring the use of smart contracts, which can automate and streamline legal processes, making them more efficient and cost-effective."
