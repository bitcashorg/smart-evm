The post outlines five problems that can arise from using token value as a performance metric: innocuous gaming, malicious gaming, multitasking, free riding, and risk misalignment."

One of its key insights is that blockchain technology can reduce the 'cost of networking', which is the inefficiencies caused by the market power of internet giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Blockchain technology can leverage network effects without the detrimental impact of market power because it creates assets that cannot be owned. This means that no single entity can control the network and exert market power over it. However, this also presents a challenge for blockchain startups who want to raise funds or earn revenues from their creations. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) offer one solution by allowing developers to collect funds upfront by pre-selling access to the platform they are building."
