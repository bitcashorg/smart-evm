          "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI): A field of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including but not limited to learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.\nBlockchain: A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures security, transparency, and immutability.\nCryptocurrency: Digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank, leveraging blockchain technology for decentralized financial transactions.\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO): A type of organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government.\nTokenization: The process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain, facilitating easier and more flexible transactions.\nMint- and - Burn Model: A tokenomics strategy where tokens are \",minted\", or created to increase supply and \",burned\", or destroyed to reduce supply, often used to manage a token's value and supply.\nBatch/Dutch Auction: A market structure in which the price of an offering is established after taking in all bids to determine the highest price at which the total offering can be sold.\nGnosis Auction: A platform that allows for fair price discovery and decentralized auctions, particularly used within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nEOS EVM: Refers to the EOSIO Ethereum Virtual Machine, which enables Ethereum smart contracts to run on the EOS blockchain, enhancing performance and scalability.\nSmart Contracts: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code, allowing for transactions and agreements to be carried out without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.\nKYC (Know Your Customer): A process of verifying the identity of clients by businesses, particularly in the financial sector, to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing.\nAML (Anti-Money Laundering): A set of procedures, laws, and regulations designed to stop the practice of generating income through illegal actions and ensuring investments are not used for funding illegal activities.\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): A regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area, focusing on giving control to individuals over their personal data.\nEnd - to - End Encryption: A method of secure communication that prevents third - parties from accessing data while it's transferred from one end system or device to another.\nPenetration Testing: A simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.\nHot-stuff Consensus Mechanism: A leader-based consensus mechanism known for its high performance and strong security properties, particularly in blockchain environments.\nSeed Funding: An initial investment to start a business in exchange for equity or an interest in the company.\nWebAuthn: A web standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for secure and passwordless authentication on the Web, part of the FIDO2 specification.\nLayer 1 (L1): This term refers to the base layer or underlying blockchain architecture of a decentralized network. Layer 1 is the foundational level that includes the core blockchain technology responsible for validating and recording transactions. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum operate as Layer 1 networks, providing the fundamental infrastructure for additional layers and applications to build upon.Layer 1 solutions often focus on improving scalability, security, and decentralization directly within the main blockchain itself.",
