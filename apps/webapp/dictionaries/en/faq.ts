          question:
            'How does BitLauncher ensure fair price discovery for token auctions?',
          answer:
            'BitLauncher utilizes batch auctions, a mechanism that matches limit orders of buyers and sellers with the same clearing price for all participants. This method ensures fair price discovery by reducing frontrunning and gas bidding wars, providing a transparent and efficient auction process. Batch auctions are particularly important for decentralized teams needing fair token distributions.'
        },
        {
          question:
            'What makes BitLauncher different from other auction platforms?',
          answer:
            "Unlike some auction solutions that rely on a centralized curation process, BitLauncher is permissionless, allowing any Ethereum project or community to conduct decentralized batch auctions securely and efficiently. BitLauncher's open-source smart contract enables projects to quickly create their own fair auctions, ensuring transparent and fair price discovery."
        },
