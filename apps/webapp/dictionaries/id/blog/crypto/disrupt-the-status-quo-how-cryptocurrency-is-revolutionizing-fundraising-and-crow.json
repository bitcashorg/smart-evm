One of its key insights is that blockchain technology can reduce the 'cost of networking', which is the inefficiencies caused by the market power of internet giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Blockchain technology can leverage network effects without the detrimental impact of market power because it creates assets that cannot be owned. This means that no single entity can control the network and exert market power over it. However, this also presents a challenge for blockchain startups who want to raise funds or earn revenues from their creations. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) offer one solution by allowing developers to collect funds upfront by pre-selling access to the platform they are building."

By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, decentralization, and global communities, TEM ensures fairness, flexibility, and sustainability. The Dutch Auction token sale process tackles the challenge of determining market prices by utilizing dynamic pricing mechanisms and transparent, decentralized processes. Simultaneously, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) provide the perfect solution for fair token distribution and rewarding contributors based on predetermined rules encoded into smart contracts. Together, the Dutch Auction process and DAOs revolutionize the token sale landscape, instilling confidence, trust, and integrity in the entire ecosystem. It's time to embrace these innovative approaches and pave the way for a more inclusive and sustainable token economy. Let's bid farewell to outdated models and embark on a new era of tokenomics with TEM, Dutch Auctions, and DAOs."
