This often leads to inflexible token allocations and the release of a large portion of the token supply too early, leaving little remaining supply to reward future contributors."

Both types of structures have their own pros and cons, and the choice of structure will depend on the specific goals and objectives of the DAO. Whether a DAO is operating as a company or a non-profit organization, it's essential to choose a structure that aligns with the goals and objectives of the organization and provides the necessary legal protections for its members."
