Step 1: Sign Up and KYC Verification
Register for an Account: Begin by creating your Bitcash wallet account on our official website. This will be your gateway to participate in the presale.

Complete KYC Verification: To ensure a secure and compliant capital contribution environment, complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This is essential for preventing fraud and complying with anti-money laundering regulations.

Geolocation Verification: Ensure your device’s privacy settings are configured to share geolocation data. This helps us mitigate Sybil attacks and ensure the legitimacy of each participant.

Restrictions: Please note that residents from the US or countries under US sanctions cannot participate in the presale.

Step 2: Deposit Funds
Connect Your Wallet: Use an EVM-compatible wallet like Metamask to deposit USDT or USDC into the Bitcash deposit contract. Our platform supports various EVM chains including Ethereum, Cosmos, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Avalanche.

Credit Allocation: Once your funds are deposited, a USD equivalent credit will be added to your Bitlauncher account. These credits are what you will use to acquire presale tokens at a fixed price.

Step 3: Acquire Presale Tokens
Fixed Price Purchase: With your account credited, you can purchase presale tokens directly at the set price of $1 per token. There’s no bidding involved—simply decide how many tokens you want based on your credit balance and complete the transaction. The maximum purchase amount is $1,500.

Token Distribution
Conversion and Allocation: Presale tokens will be eligible for conversion into main tokens shortly after the main token sale concludes. Details on the conversion process will be provided as we approach the token sale date.

Token Distribution: All acquired presale tokens will be distributed within two weeks after the main token auction sale ends. Keep in mind that while these tokens may not be immediately listed on external exchanges, they could gain liquidity through subsequent monthly auctions or a potential internal Bitcash exchange in the future.

Additional Information
Supported Wallets and Exchanges: We will continually update information on supported wallets and potential future exchange listings. Stay tuned to our official channels for the latest updates.

Compliance: Our adherence to stringent KYC and AML standards is designed to protect not only our platform but also all our participants, ensuring the integrity and security of every transaction.

Join us on this exciting venture and be part of shaping the future of AI and blockchain. By participating in the Bitlauncher presale, you’re not just buying tokens; you’re becoming an integral part of a community poised to revolutionize technology and finance. For more details, visit Bitlauncher.
